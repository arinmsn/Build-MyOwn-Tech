/*

Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and
outputs the result. For example:

+ 100 3.14
* 4 5

Read the operation into a string called operation and use an
if -statement to figure out which operation the user wants, for example,
if (operation== " + " ) . Read the operands into variables of type double .
Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div
with their obvious meanings.
