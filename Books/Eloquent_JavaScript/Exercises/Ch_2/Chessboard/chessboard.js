/*
Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to
separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character.
The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern,
define a binding size = 8 and change the program so
that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the
given width and height.
