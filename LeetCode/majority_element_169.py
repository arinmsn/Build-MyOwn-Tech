"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2



Constraints:

    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 5 * 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
